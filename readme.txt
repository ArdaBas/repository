This package contains the data files for a game which is currently under development.
This quest is a free, open-source game that works with Solarus,
an open-source Zelda-like 2D game engine. To play this game, you need Solarus.

You can download the last version of the Solarus engine from
http://www.solarus-games.org

This game is intended to be, someday if it is finished, a hybrid game, combining
the mechanics of action RPG 2D games (Zelda-like 2D games) with the mechanics
of the game "The Lost Vikings 2" (a game where you can control several characters
with different abilities and you can switch between them).
